<h1># Delegatecall vs Call ‚Äì Solidity Classwork</h1>

This project demonstrates the difference between `call` and `delegatecall` in Solidity by deploying two contracts (`A` and `B`) with identical storage layouts and observing how storage is affected when calling functions across them.

<hr>

## üì¶ Contracts

- **ContractA.sol**: The main contract that performs both `call` and `delegatecall`.
- **ContractB.sol**: Contains the `setVars(uint256)` logic to be called or delegate-called; also uses contract A storage.

## üöÄ Deployment Details

- **Network**: Ethereum Sepolia testnet
- **Chain ID**: `11155111`  
- **Deployed via**: Foundry script with `--broadcast` enabled

## üìå Deployed Addresses

- **Contract A**: `0xde92aaa7e6f83f65d28e861db42b06bbf6360440`  
- **Contract B**: `0xb9435810d853a60dee2c9699e6f96564a0b89eab`

## ‚ùì Answers to Classwork Questions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What differences did you observe between `call` and `delegatecall`?

- `call`: Executes the target contract‚Äôs code in **its own** context. Storage changes affect **Contract B**, and `msg.sender` becomes **Contract A**.
- `delegatecall`: Runs the target‚Äôs code in **the calling contract‚Äôs** context. Storage and `msg.sender` refer to **Contract A**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why must the storage layout in ContractA and ContractB be exactly the same when using `delegatecall`?

- `delegatecall` writes to the caller‚Äôs (Contract A's) storage.
- If layouts don‚Äôt match, data will be written to **wrong slots**, leading to corrupted state.
- Matching layouts ensures Contract B‚Äôs logic updates the correct variables in Contract A.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Which method would you use for creating upgradeable contracts and why?

- ‚úÖ **Use `delegatecall`**
- It separates **logic (Contract B)** from **storage (Contract A)**.
- This is the core of upgradeable patterns like **UUPS** and **Transparent Proxy**, where storage must persist across upgrades.

## üß™ How to Run This Project

```bash
# 1. Start a local anvil chain
anvil

# 2. In a new terminal, export RPC and private key
export RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
export PRIVATE_KEY=<any key from anvil>

# 3. Run the deployment script
forge script script/Contract.s.sol:DeployAndRun --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
